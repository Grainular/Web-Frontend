# Frontend for Granular WebApp

![alt text](image.png)

Landsat Surface Reflectance (SR) data can give farmers crucial agricultural information such as water use and crop health.

This data has historically been difficult to access and interpret. A strong internet connection is required to download the almost a gigabyte of data that must be parsed for useful information.

The Grainular webapp provides a shortcut to what matters. By simply specifying a coordinates or placing a pin on the map, next LandSat flyover dates and historical data for that location can be retrieved.

While data can be downloaded in a csv, no data download is required.

Our additional SMS based service allows access to future Landsat flyover dates with no internet access whatsoever.

Built in React.
